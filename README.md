# NeuralNetworkTest
A Basic implementation of a simple Classifier Feed Forward neural network that can compute MNIST Data
Includes an implementation in NeuralNetwork.py and 2 Jupyter Notebooks:

Machine Learning uses the NN with a simple scikit clusters generated dataset  
MNIST Training imports the EMNIST Dataset and trains on that

With the hardware available and the fairly limited optimisation of the NeuralNetwork.py implementation I was able to 
achieve roughly 85% accuracy with EMNIST. Higher Accuracy is likely possible as the gradient of accuracy was still 
negative but would take significantly more training or optimisation
